# LagaltNet

Lagalt is a collaborative full-stack development project that aims to create a system connecting individuals in creative fields with projects that match their skills. The site covers Music, Film, Game Development, and Web Development at a minimum but can be expanded to other fields.

This project is the frontend part of the lagalt web app, which is connected to a backend server with a REST API. The front end part is made with Angular and TypeScript, and are using Tailwind for a nice look.
